## Node and Express Mentor 👩🏻‍💻 👨🏾‍💻 👨🏻‍💻 👩🏽‍💻 Code Challenge

Thank you 🙏 for taking the time to implement this coding challenge to build a fast microservice REST API using *JavaScript* and *Express*.

## Conditions

* Take 2-4 hours to implement your project.
* Use coding best practices.
* Create a fork of this repo and share your solution when finished.


## Coding Challenge  💻 

A bus company wants to start using technology and allow their users to book online tickets. Please help them build a [REST API Level 2](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html#level2)(pereferible) that lets them control their trip bookings, supporting the following operations:
* Create a new booking with the following information: name, email, origin, destination, departure date and time and duration.
* Update an existing booking
* Find a booking using its ID.
* Delete an existing booking.

*Note:* Use Express to create the server to the REST API and use [Mongodb Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) as the persistance layer.  

## Expected Quality Attributes:
* Use coding best practices: Code style, naming conventions, etc.
* Correct data modeling to store information in a flexible way.
* Create reusable functions.
* Clear usage of Express framework.
* Clear usage of Mongoose framework.

## Desired technology stack:
* JavaScript or TypeScript
* Express
* Node
* MongoDB
* Mongoose

## Submit your solution

Once you're done, please send us an email to [tech@ada-school.org](mailto:tech@ada-school.org) with the subject: TECH_CHALLENGE_[YOUR NAME] and do not forget to include the link to your repository with the solution.
